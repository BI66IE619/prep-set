      <p>
        Hi, I’m a young developer who has been passionate about coding since I first 
        discovered how websites and programs work behind the scenes. I started by 
        experimenting with simple HTML pages, then dove deeper into JavaScript, UI design, 
        app building, AI tools, and backend systems. Over time, I learned how powerful 
        technology can be when you use it creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        What inspires me most is being able to take an idea and turn it into something real — 
        something people can use. I love solving problems, designing interfaces, building 
        tools that help others, and learning new things every day. This project is a reflection 
        of how far I’ve come and how excited I am to keep growing as a developer.
