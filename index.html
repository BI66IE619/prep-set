            <p>
                Hi, I’m the creator of this platform — a dedicated student and self-taught developer who
                started coding out of curiosity and a passion for building things that make life easier.
                Over the years, I’ve experimented with web development, game engines, UI/UX design, and AI tools,
                shaping all of that experience into this project.
            </p>
            <p>
                What inspired me most was realizing how powerful simple tools can be when they’re designed
                with real problems in mind. Whether it was helping friends with schoolwork, automating
                boring tasks, or experimenting with creative ideas, coding became a way for me to turn
                ideas into functional projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                This dashboard is the result of that journey — a clean, modern, and powerful workspace that
                reflects everything I’ve learned and everything I enjoy building.
            </p>
